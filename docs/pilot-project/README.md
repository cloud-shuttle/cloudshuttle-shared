# 🚀 Phase 0: Shared Repository Pilot Project

**Date**: October 1, 2025
**Status**: ACTIVE - Pilot Launch
**Duration**: Week 1 (October 1-7, 2025)
**Goal**: Validate improvement approach through real service integration

---

## 🎯 **Pilot Objectives**

### **Primary Goal**
Validate the shared repository improvement initiative by successfully integrating **2 high-impact services** with enhanced shared components.

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ **Compilation Success**: Both pilot services compile with updated shared components
- ✅ **Functionality Preserved**: No breaking changes to existing service functionality
- ✅ **Performance Improvement**: Measure and demonstrate compilation/integration time improvements
- ✅ **Developer Feedback**: Positive feedback on ease of use and feature completeness

---

## 👥 **Pilot Services Selected**

### **Service A: Authentication Service**
**Why Selected**: High business impact, already uses shared auth components, perfect candidate for advanced features
- **Current State**: Uses basic shared auth, implements advanced features separately
- **Expected Benefits**: Access to token introspection, PKCE, audit logging from shared components
- **Risk Level**: Medium (auth is security-critical)
- **Timeline Impact**: High visibility, quick wins possible

### **Service B: User Management Service**
**Why Selected**: Database-heavy, represents common service patterns, benefits from database improvements
- **Current State**: Custom database patterns, basic error handling
- **Expected Benefits**: Improved connection pooling, error handling, observability
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium (user management is well-understood domain)
- **Timeline Impact**: Good secondary validation of improvements

- **API Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility during pilot
- **Performance Regression**: Monitor and document any degradation

### **Organizational Risks**
- **Service Owner Availability**: Have backup services ready
- **Timeline Slippage**: Extend pilot if needed, focus on learning
